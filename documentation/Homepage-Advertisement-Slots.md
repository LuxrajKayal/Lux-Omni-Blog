# Homepage Advertisement Slots

## Purpose
Plan a clean, CNET-inspired advertising system for the Lux Omni Blog homepage. Advertisements should generate revenue without overcrowding the interface or degrading the reading experience.

## Initial Homepage Slot Plan

### Slot 1 — Main Banner Advertisement
- **Position:** Below the Featured Story section and above the main article feed.
- **Format:** Wide, responsive banner slot.
- **Example desktop dimensions:** 970 × 250 px; this is a planning example, not a mandatory final size.
- **Behavior:** Keep the ad within its allocated area without distorting the creative. Adapt appropriately on smaller screens.
- **Label:** Clearly identify it as an advertisement.
- **Empty/disabled state:** Hide the slot when disabled or when no ad is available, rather than leaving a large blank area.

### Slot 2 — In-Feed Advertisement
- **Position:** Within the homepage article feed, after several article cards.
- **Behavior:** Keep the ad clearly distinguishable from editorial content. Do not interrupt an individual article card.
- **Initial limit:** One in-feed ad.

### Future Option — Sidebar Advertisement
- Not part of the initial homepage design.
- Consider later only if the layout has sufficient space and the placement does not make the homepage feel crowded.

## Advertising Strategy

### 1. Google AdSense First
- Prepare the site for Google AdSense from the beginning.
- Use manually positioned ad units rather than relying entirely on Google Auto ads, so the website layout remains under the site owner's control.
- Actual AdSense delivery and earnings depend on site/account approval, configuration, policy compliance, and eligible ad activity.
- A new website may apply when it is live and meets the provider's requirements, but approval is not guaranteed or instantaneous.
- Do not assume AdSense revenue will be available on launch day.

### 2. Add Other Advertising Networks Later
- Keep the design flexible enough to support other networks if the site becomes eligible and the chosen providers' requirements are met.
- Do not assume that all networks use the same approval process, ad formats, or payment model.

### 3. Direct Company Advertisements
- Support separately managed banner campaigns when a company approaches Lux Omni.
- Review and approve the creative before publishing.
- Configure placement, dimensions, destination link and campaign dates as agreed with the advertiser.
- Revenue comes from the agreement with the advertiser; it is not automatically based on impressions unless the agreement specifies that model.
- Plan the detailed direct-ad workflow when a real opportunity and its requirements are known.

## Ad Quality and Brand Control
The site owner wants to avoid low-quality or unsuitable advertisements and retain as much control as the selected advertising provider permits.

- Use provider-level review and blocking tools where available, including relevant categories and specific advertisers.
- Prefer ads relevant to technology, computing, electronics, drones, software and related topics where the provider's controls permit.
- Review ads periodically and block unsuitable ads using available provider controls.
- Direct campaigns must be reviewed and approved before publication.
- Understand that network controls cannot guarantee that every ad will meet the site owner's preferences in advance.
- Excessive blocking may reduce the pool of eligible ads and potential revenue.
- Label advertisements clearly and do not disguise ads as editorial content.

## Developer Control Panel Requirements
Plan for an Advertisement Management section in the developer control panel. These are intended capabilities, not implemented features.

For each supported slot, the panel should eventually allow:
- Enable/disable the slot independently.
- Select a predefined slot position supported by the website.
- Choose an approved ad provider or direct campaign.
- Configure supported dimensions and responsive behavior.
- Preview the slot before enabling it.
- Show slot status.
- For direct campaigns, configure campaign dates, banner image, destination link and other agreed details.
- Hide a disabled or empty slot instead of leaving a large blank space.

The code must define the available slots and their layout. Configuration settings cannot create a new layout capability that the website code does not support.

## Supabase Configuration Concept
The advertising configuration may be stored in Supabase so routine changes do not require editing the website source code each time.

Possible configuration fields include:
- Slot ID and predefined position.
- Enabled/disabled status.
- Approved provider identifier.
- Ad slot identifier or other non-secret configuration.
- Supported dimensions and responsive settings.
- Direct campaign details, including banner reference, destination link and campaign dates.

Implementation and schema are not yet designed.

### Security and integration principles
- Keep the core advertising integration and approved script-loading logic in the website code.
- Avoid fetching arbitrary JavaScript from the database and executing it.
- Use appropriate Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
- Public visitors should only be able to read the configuration intended to be public.
- Only authorized administrators should be able to change ad settings.
- Never expose Supabase service-role keys or other privileged secrets in public client-side code.
- Provider-specific ad code must comply with that provider's requirements.

## Fixed-Size and Responsive Slots
- The website controls the position and allocated space of each ad slot.
- Use appropriate fixed-size or responsive ad-unit settings supported by the provider.
- Do not distort or indiscriminately crop ad creatives to force them into a box.
- Fixed-size units may reduce the pool of eligible ads for some providers; confirm the current provider guidance during implementation.
- Direct company banners can use dimensions agreed with the advertiser.
- Ensure mobile layouts use appropriate sizing and do not overflow the viewport.

## Monetization Clarification
Manually placing an ad does not, by itself, guarantee income.

### Network advertising
- A provider such as Google AdSense must approve/activate the site and account as required before ads can generate eligible revenue.
- Revenue depends on the provider's model and eligible activity; an impression or display does not necessarily guarantee payment.
- Invalid activity may be excluded from earnings.
- A new website can apply once it is live and meets the provider's requirements, but approval is not guaranteed or immediate.
- Do not assume that AdSense revenue will be available on launch day.

### Direct advertising
- Direct advertising may generate revenue as soon as a paid campaign begins under an agreed contract or arrangement, even if AdSense has not approved the site.
- Payment terms, campaign duration and whether compensation is fixed-fee or impression-based must be agreed with the advertiser.

## Initial Design Rules
- No pop-up advertisements on the homepage.
- No ads covering navigation or article text.
- No autoplay audio.
- No flashing animations intended to attract unnecessary attention.
- No ads disguised as editorial content.
- No empty large slots when an ad is unavailable.
- Avoid placements that encourage accidental clicks.
- Follow the policies of each selected advertising provider.
