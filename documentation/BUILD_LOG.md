# Luxraj Blog — Build and Planning Log

**Implementation status:** Initial shared navigation/search/theme implementation completed; broader homepage and editorial content build remains in progress.

Append-only after implementation begins. Record real milestones only; do not pre-fill future work as completed.

## Planning milestone — 2026-10-25
- Discussed excluding a separate backend/local Article Studio from the initial scope.
- Updated draft workflow to author individual HTML articles in VS Code, use proposed Git/GitHub checkpoints, and include SEO fundamentals from the beginning.
- Hosting/deployment, backend, and control-panel choices remain unresolved.
- No code, repository, or deployment changes were made.


## 2026-10-25 — Article-group page planning update

- Documented the homepage → group landing page → individual article hierarchy.
- Recorded six linkable sample articles per final group for development testing and a canonical article-template contract.
- Updated planning documents only; no repository or deployment changes occurred.

## 2026-10-25 — Initial repository skeleton

- Added a blank public-site skeleton under `site/`.
- Added root-level `documentation/` with the planning reference files.
- Added a separate blank `control-panel/` skeleton for the future application.
- Added six blank sample article files in each of the five currently listed article groups (30 sample files total).
- No website implementation code or article content was added. The existing root `README.md` was left unchanged.


## 2026-10-25 — Main header, category destinations, search and theme

- Implemented the single-row CNET-inspired navigation with the supplied transparent-symbol SVG and a bold uppercase crimson LUXRAJ wordmark that remains crimson across themes.
- Added direct parent links and separate click-operated dropdown controls for Tech, Reviews, How To, Hardware, Software and Buying Advice; hover does not open menus.
- Added dedicated parent and dropdown-category landing pages and linkable sample article HTML pages for all current menu categories.
- Implemented the search popup with text search, category filtering, a reading-time slider and sorting by date/category/article title.
- Implemented a persistent light/dark theme toggle and placed JavaScript in the existing `site/assets/js/` structure with `main.js` as the entry point.
- Added responsive navigation and updated the file map and navigation planning documents. The finalized copper topbar stylesheet and design tokens were not changed.


## 2026-10-27 — Control panel removed

- Deleted the complete `control-panel/` directory and its HTML/CSS/JavaScript placeholders.
- Updated `.github/workflows/pages.yml` to publish only `site/`; removed the `/dev/` assembly, control-panel existence check, and control-panel path trigger.
- Updated active architecture and feature planning documents to use manual source-file configuration instead of a control-panel workflow.
- No public-site source files were changed as part of this removal.


## 2026-10-27 — Category folder migration

- Reorganized seven main categories and 44 subcategories beneath `site/categories/`, using distinct descriptive landing-page filenames. `site/index.html` remains the only `index.html` page.
- Migrated 40 existing populated sample articles into their subcategory-specific `articles/` folders with descriptive filenames.
- Added Engineering's Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Labs and Drone Technology topic pages, with five sample articles per topic.
- Updated article-index hrefs, the dynamic Engineering navigation, local links/assets and each page's `data-site-root`.
- Preserved old `sections/` and `articles/` URLs with compatibility redirects and regenerated the canonical sitemap with 112 URLs.
- Kept all CSS files unchanged.

## 2026-10-27 — Legacy redirect and template-placeholder cleanup

- Deleted 52 legacy landing-page redirect files from `site/sections/` and 46 legacy article redirect files from the top-level `site/articles/`.
- Removed the now-empty legacy folders; canonical category pages and articles remain under `site/categories/`.
- Intentionally deleted the empty `site/templates/article-template.html` placeholder. No shared article-template file currently exists.
- Kept the canonical sitemap unchanged at 112 URLs and preserved the existing CSS files.
- Updated `documentation/Luxraj-Blog-FileMap.md` to describe the actual repository structure.

## 2026-10-27 — Shared shell components and homepage-only build

- Added source-only partials for the topbar, main navigation header (including the search dialog), and footer under site/partials/.
- Added scripts/build-site.mjs to expand explicit shared-component markers into full HTML at build time, resolve local component links for the current page depth, exclude source partials from public output, and verify the built homepage shell.
- Migrated only site/index.html to shared markers. Category, subcategory, article, and other pages retain their existing markup until the owner approves each subsequent migration step.
- Kept the footer content blank and retained the existing dedicated CSS files.
- Updated the GitHub Pages workflow to run the build before deployment and updated the file map to describe the implemented source/build/output structure.


## 2026-10-27 — Source-level shared shell migration

- Migrated all 112 populated HTML pages under `site/` to one explicit marker each for the canonical topbar, main header/search dialog, and footer.
- Removed the duplicated inline topbar, main header, and search dialog from category, subcategory, and article source files; replaced any existing shared footer shell where present, and added the shared footer marker to each populated page.
- Preserved page-specific content, metadata, URLs, CSS references, and JavaScript; five empty HTML placeholders were left unchanged.
- Reworked `scripts/build-site.mjs` into a marker-only assembler. It rejects populated pages with missing/duplicate markers or leftover hardcoded shared shell markup instead of automatically replacing legacy source markup.
- Updated the file map to describe the source-level shared-component structure and strict build behavior.

## 2026-10-27 — Initial shared footer content

- Replaced the empty footer partial with a brand summary, round author avatar/profile link, seven main-category links, the existing article-search trigger, a link to the public source repository, copyright, and Back to Top.
- Kept the author-page destination at the requested temporary `https://example.com` URL; the avatar uses the repository owner's public GitHub profile image.
- Implemented responsive footer columns and theme-aware text masks so the circuit pattern does not show through the footer's text.
- Left optional RSS/Atom/JSON feeds, recent-posts module, status page, newsletter, social-link list, and unfinished policy destinations out of this implementation.

## 2026-10-27 — Dark theme first-visit default

- Changed the theme initializer fallback to dark mode when no valid preference is saved; saved `light` or `dark` values continue to take priority.
- Kept the existing localStorage key and theme-toggle persistence behavior unchanged.
- Updated the design-token documentation to reflect the dark first-visit default.

## 2026-10-27 — Remove source-code link from footer

- Removed the “Source Code on GitHub” item from the shared footer Quick Links section.
- Kept the existing Search Articles action and all other footer content unchanged.
- Updated the FileMap footer description to match the current content.

## 2026-10-27 — Sticky main header

- Changed the shared main header from normal relative positioning to `position: sticky; top: 0`, so it scrolls up beneath the topbar and remains pinned at the viewport top once it reaches that edge.
- Kept the existing header height, colors, navigation, dropdown, search, and theme styling unchanged.

## 2026-10-27 — Prepare five tagged hero-image samples

- Added one local WebP sample image to each of five Tech News articles: AI on the edge, phone hardware, computer processors, display refresh rates/HDR, and gaming PC upgrades.
- Marked each chosen article-body image with `data-hero-image` and added accessible alt text and a short illustrative caption.
- Added responsive featured-image styling to `section-page.css` and documented the image-marker convention in the FileMap.
- Prepared source articles for the future curated hero showcase; no hero carousel or image-fetching logic was added in this step.

## 2026-10-28 — Curated homepage hero showcase

- Replaced the homepage's decorative LO visual with a curated article slide that retrieves each configured article's h1 and explicitly marked `img[data-hero-image]` from same-origin article HTML.
- Configured five manually maintained article URLs in `site/assets/js/hero-showcase.js`; changing that list controls which articles appear, up to five.
- Added five-second automatic rotation, previous/next controls, slide indicators, pause/play, pause-on-hover, tab-visibility handling, and reduced-motion support.
- Added responsive showcase styling in `hero.css` and initialized it from `main.js`; image and headline links each point to the exact configured article URL.
- Kept the rest of the homepage content and all article sources unchanged.

## 2026-10-28 — Compact hero showcase layout

- Moved the curated article headline onto the bottom of the image with a dark gradient, single-line ellipsis truncation, and a small open-article icon.
- Moved previous/next arrows to the left and right sides of the image; removed the duplicate featured-article label, separate Read article link, dots, and bottom control bar.
- Kept the top Editor's Picks label and slide counter, the five-second rotation interval, exact article links, and pause-on-hover/focus and hidden-tab handling.

## 2026-10-28 — Add hero-section editing guide

- Added `Edit-Guide/hero-section-link -edit.md` with instructions for editing the manual `FEATURED_ARTICLE_URLS` list in `site/assets/js/hero-showcase.js`.
- Documented the site-root-relative URL format, the article `h1` and `img[data-hero-image]` requirements, the five-article limit, rotation order, and publish/verification workflow.
- Documented the new `Edit-Guide/` folder in the FileMap; no website runtime files were changed.

## 2026-10-28 — Add topbar-links editing guide

- Added `Edit-Guide/topbar-links -edit.md` with the source file, exact markup patterns, and steps for updating the logo/home link, slogan, newsletter destination, social profiles, email address, and About link.
- Documented the `{{ROOT}}` path token, the shared partial/build workflow, and the distinction between content edits in `topbar.html` and visual changes in `topbar.css`.
- Kept the FileMap and all public-site runtime files unchanged.

## 2026-10-30 — Remove redundant homepage sections

- Removed the “Browse by Interest / Explore the topics” category-card section from `site/index.html`.
- Removed the hardcoded “Latest Sample Stories / Fresh perspectives” article-card section and the temporary development-preview notice from the homepage; the linked sample article files remain intact.
- Removed the homepage's now-unused `section-page.css` stylesheet reference and obsolete homepage-only category-grid, spacing and development-notice CSS, including their responsive rules.
- Preserved the homepage hero and Editor's Picks carousel, shared topbar/header/footer, article files, shared article-card styling used by category pages, and the FileMap.

## 2026-10-30 — Add Technical Pioneer homepage placeholder

- Added a blank “Technical Pioneer born today” section immediately below the homepage hero.
- Created a dedicated `technical-pioneer.css` stylesheet for the section title and empty bordered panel, matching the homepage hero's surface, border, radius and width conventions.
- Kept the section content empty; no person data, image, quotation, article link, fetch logic or JavaScript was added.
- Left the existing hero, shared header/footer, FileMap and article files unchanged.

## 2026-10-30 — Keep Technical Pioneer placeholder blank

- Removed the visible section heading from the homepage; the section now contains only its empty bordered panel.
- Removed the heading-specific CSS. Kept the section's accessible label, position, panel dimensions, border, radius, and dedicated stylesheet.
- No data, image, quotation, article card, fetching logic or JavaScript was added.

## 2026-10-30 — Add SEO heading to Technical Pioneer section

- Added the eyebrow “On This Day in Science & Engineering”, the H2 “Famous Scientists, Engineers & Inventors Born Today”, and a concise supporting description above the existing empty panel.
- Kept the content panel blank; no person data, portrait, quotation, article details, external fetch, or JavaScript was added.
- Kept all section typography and layout in the dedicated `technical-pioneer.css` file. The FileMap and unrelated homepage components were not changed.

## 2026-10-30 — Refine Technical Pioneer description

- Replaced the Technical Pioneer section's introductory description with concise wording focused on a relevant theory, principle or original passage paired with a related Luxraj article.
- Preserved the heading, empty content panel, section layout, dedicated stylesheet and all other homepage content.
- No daily data, images, quotations, article content or fetching behavior was added.

## 2026-10-30 — Widen Technical Pioneer description

- Removed the 900px intro-container and 75ch description width caps so the supporting description can use the available homepage content width on desktop.
- Kept natural text wrapping for smaller viewports; did not force `white-space: nowrap` or change typography, spacing, heading, or panel dimensions.

## 2026-11-02 — First shared article-layout implementation

- Added the optional source-only `site/partials/article-layout.html` frame and extended `scripts/build-site.mjs` to assemble article-specific HEADER and CONTENT slots at build time. Pages that do not use the optional marker continue through the existing shell build unchanged.
- Applied the frame only to `site/categories/engineering/drone-technology/articles/a-pre-flight-inspection-checklist-for-small-drones.html` as the approved first test article.
- Kept the breadcrumb, title, description, author/date row and share/copy controls in the full-width entry header. The featured image, article body and references occupy the left column. The right sidebar rail is empty; no ad slots, ad elements or ad data were added.
- Added `site/assets/css/article-layout.css` for the shared frame geometry and `site/assets/js/article-share.js` for the header's share/copy controls. Existing article CSS files and other article HTML files were not changed.
- At a 1,100px viewport, the 80rem maximum container with 1rem side gutters and a 12-column 8/4 grid with 3rem gaps produces a 696px article column, 48px gap and 324px sidebar rail. The two columns stack below 1,024px.
- Updated the FileMap. GitHub Actions run [#125](https://github.com/LuxrajKayal/Luxraj-Blog/actions/runs/41497622839) completed successfully, including the public-site build and GitHub Pages deployment.


## 2026-11-03 — Unify page-title typography

- Added universal page-title tokens for desktop/mobile size, display weight and tight display letter spacing, preserving the established landing-page H1 appearance.
- Updated the global H1 rule in `base.css` to use those tokens.
- Removed duplicate H1 typography overrides from `section-page.css`, `responsive.css` and `article-layout.css`; component-specific spacing and the article introduction's responsive sizing remain.
- Added `base.css` to the approved pre-flight test article so its entry H1 uses the same universal H1 rule as landing pages. Removed the now-unused Source Serif 4 font request from that test page.
- Other article pages were not migrated or modified. The change is limited to the shared H1 foundation and the existing approved test article.


## 2026-11-03 — Allow article introduction to use full header width

- Removed the `max-width: var(--content-width-reading)` constraint from `.article-introduction` in `site/assets/css/article-layout.css`.
- Preserved its existing font, font size, weight, text color, line height and top spacing. The description now uses the available article-entry header width and wraps naturally.
- Did not change the global `--content-width-reading` token or any other article layout rules.


## 2026-11-03 — Unify breadcrumb component styling

- Moved the existing landing-page `.breadcrumbs` rules into the dedicated `site/assets/css/breadcrumbs.css` stylesheet without changing their normal or hover colors, spacing, or typography.
- Made `section-page.css` import the shared breadcrumb stylesheet so existing landing pages retain their appearance.
- Changed the approved article-layout test page to use the same `.breadcrumbs` class and standard separator markup, and loaded `breadcrumbs.css` directly.
- Removed the duplicate `.article-breadcrumb` rules from `article-layout.css`. The article and landing pages now share one breadcrumb selector and one visual implementation.
- Updated the FileMap. No other article pages or breadcrumb content were migrated.


## 2026-11-03 — Centralize eyebrow design

- Added dedicated `--lux-eyebrow-*` brand tokens for the eyebrow red, font family, size, weight, letter spacing, line height and uppercase transformation. Values match the existing category landing-page eyebrow treatment and remain consistent across light and dark themes.
- Added `site/assets/css/eyebrows.css` as the single shared typography and colour implementation for page, article, story-card, hero-showcase, search-result, author-card and Technical Pioneer eyebrow selectors.
- Imported the shared stylesheet from `search.css`, which is already loaded by the populated site pages.
- Removed duplicate eyebrow typography and colour rules from `layout.css`, `article-layout.css`, `section-page.css`, `hero.css`, `search.css` and `article-page.css`.
- Preserved component-specific spacing and layout rules. Eyebrow wording remains authored in each HTML page or component; no page copy was changed.


## 2026-11-03 — Increase centralized eyebrow text size

- Increased `--lux-eyebrow-font-size` in `site/assets/css/tokens.css` from `0.72rem` (approximately 11.5px) to `0.875rem` (14px) to improve visibility across all centralized eyebrow components.
- Left eyebrow colour, font family, weight, letter spacing, line height, text transformation, component spacing and page content unchanged.


## 2026-11-03 — Centralize standard H1 typography

- Added dedicated `--lux-h1-*` brand tokens for font family, responsive size, weight, line height, letter spacing, text color and text wrapping. The values preserve the existing standard category/subcategory H1 appearance.
- Added `site/assets/css/h1.css` as the single standard H1 typography implementation and imported it through `search.css`, which is already loaded by populated pages including article pages that do not load `base.css`.
- Removed the standard H1 typography rule from `base.css`; its shared heading defaults now apply to H2–H6, while H1 typography is owned by `h1.css`.
- Kept the homepage hero H1 typography unchanged in `hero.css`. Its more-specific component rule continues to override the standard H1 style intentionally.
- Preserved component-specific H1 margins and layout rules in `section-page.css` and `article-layout.css`. No HTML content or heading text was changed.

- Corrected the H1 token-section comment labels; no token values or rendered styles changed.


## 2026-11-03 — Rename shared H1 stylesheet

- Renamed `site/assets/css/h1.css` to `site/assets/css/shared-h1.css` to distinguish the shared standard H1 system from the homepage hero's independent H1 styling.
- Updated the import in `search.css` and the stylesheet references in the FileMap.
- Kept the stylesheet contents, H1 tokens, selectors, typography, responsive behavior and homepage hero styling unchanged.

## 2026-11-03 — Implement reusable author details bar pilot

- Added the standalone, reusable `site/assets/css/author-bar.css` component stylesheet. Author-bar styling is not placed in `article-page.css` and is not tied to one page layout.
- Added `site/assets/js/author-bar.js` to render the single horizontal author and sharing bar using the article's author ID and article-specific publication/modification dates.
- Extended `site/assets/js/author-library.js` with a temporary Luxraj Kayal sample record containing the author name, handle, author-page route and sample photograph.
- Updated `main.js` to initialize the new author bar. The old author-card module and stylesheet were not repurposed as the new bar.
- Updated `article-share.js` for the bar's Copy Link and Instagram device-share/copy-fallback controls while retaining support for the older article-share attributes. Facebook and X use their share links.
- Replaced the previous metadata/share row only in `a-pre-flight-inspection-checklist-for-small-drones.html`, loaded `author-bar.css`, and kept its existing SEO author metadata unchanged.
- The sample portrait is a temporary crop from the approved author-bar design reference. The author profile route is provisional until the author page exists.
- Other articles were not migrated. The new component is a pilot and should be visually reviewed before wider rollout.

## 2026-11-03 — Refine author bar as open editorial byline

- Reworked the author bar to follow the approved editorial byline reference: small circular author avatar; author name and handle on one line; published and updated dates on the line below; sharing controls aligned to the right.
- Removed the enclosing panel treatment from `author-bar.css`: no outer background, rounded container, border on all four sides or card shadow. The bar is defined by thin top and bottom rules.
- Changed the sharing area to a compact SHARE label followed by circular X, Facebook, Instagram and copy-link controls.
- Kept the bar standalone in `author-bar.css` and the renderer in `author-bar.js`. Only the existing pilot article uses this component; other articles remain unchanged.

## 2026-11-03 — Set author name to Lux Red and refine copy-link icon

- Changed `.author-bar__name` to use the shared `--brand-crimson` Lux Red token.
- Replaced the copy-link icon path with a clearer linked-chain outline and explicitly applied an unfilled SVG stroke using `currentColor`.
- Styled the copy-link control with the semantic surface, text, border and action tokens so its contrast and hover state adapt to light and dark themes.
- Left the byline layout, author handle, other social icons and article integration unchanged.

## 2026-11-03 — Repair clipboard fallback and unify share-control theme styling

- Updated the Copy Link handler to fall back to the legacy selection-copy attempt when the Clipboard API is present but rejects its write request, rather than only falling back when the API is absent.
- Added a final manual-copy prompt when automatic clipboard methods are blocked. The CMS does not report a manual prompt as an automatic copy.
- Added visible temporary feedback to the copy control for copied, manual-copy and failed states, while retaining the screen-reader status message.
- Extended the author bar's semantic, theme-aware border, surface, text and hover styling consistently across X, Facebook, Instagram and Copy Link controls.
- Kept X and Facebook as direct share-page links; Instagram continues to use the device share interface with a copy/manual fallback.

## 2026-11-05 — Rename FileMap for Luxraj Blog

- Renamed the active FileMap to `documentation/Luxraj-Blog-FileMap.md` and updated its title, project-domain reference, and repository-root folder name.
- Updated the FileMap reference in `PLAN_INDEX.md`, `UPDATE-NOTES-ARTICLE-GROUPS.md`, and this Build Log so each active reference resolves to the renamed file.
- Updated the related Technical Pioneer article-brand wording and refreshed the historical GitHub Actions run URL to the renamed repository path.
- Preserved standalone `Lux` design-token identifiers and the `Restore/` historical snapshot.


## 2026-11-05 — Rename Lux Omni project identity to Luxraj

- Updated active project documentation, editing guides, planning references, site metadata, category headings, shared components, CSS/JavaScript comments, and the article-page metadata from Lux Omni to Luxraj.
- Renamed the active planning-document filenames and the CMS planning guide to use Luxraj naming, then updated active links and FileMap references to the new filenames.
- Updated the public blog domain references to `blog.luxraj.com` and the main-site references to `luxraj.com`; refreshed the sitemap URLs and GitHub Pages project-path references for the renamed `Luxraj-Blog` repository.
- Renamed the active brand and UI image assets to Luxraj filenames and updated the source references to those assets.
- Renamed the tag-selection custom event from `luxomni:tag-select` to `luxraj:tag-select` in both its dispatcher and listener, and renamed the theme preference key to `luxraj-blog-theme`.
- Updated the article social-handle placeholder to `{{LUXRAJ_X_HANDLE}}`.
- Removed the old Facebook profile link because its replacement Luxraj profile URL has not been supplied; no replacement account URL was guessed.
- Left standalone `Lux` identifiers and all content under `Restore/` untouched.
- The GitHub Pages build and deployment workflow completed successfully for the final site-code commit `dbc575641a71f226b46e8678b379ba7394b5e36f`.


## 2026-11-06 — Finish the topbar brand identity

- Applied the existing publication motto, “Technology. Without the noise.”, to the shared topbar so the message now matches the homepage title and footer tagline.
- Removed generic social-platform homepage links and placeholder newsletter, email, and About destinations from the topbar. The only external link retained is the confirmed Luxraj GitHub profile.
- Preserved the shared topbar partial, build-safe `{{ROOT}}` homepage link, visual styling, and mobile horizontal layout.
- Updated the topbar editing guide to describe the actual component and require confirmed destinations before adding links.


## 2026-11-06 — Verify topbar build and deployment

- GitHub Actions completed the site build, artifact upload, and GitHub Pages deployment successfully for the topbar source change in commit `7cb58da06a36c1da571c124c804f7bc9135d26ca`.
